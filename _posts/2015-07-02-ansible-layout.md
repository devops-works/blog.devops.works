I have been writing playbooks for quite a while now. Along the way, I
went through various stages, and used different ways to layout Ansible
files. I guess that after going down this trial and error path, I
finally came up with something I will stick to.

I am not saying that this is the be-all and end-all of Ansible files
layout but may be it will fast forward you to a saner file layout, and
you'll be able to move on from there. This post will probably help you
if you are new to Ansible, trying to figure out what to put and where.
I hope it will prove usefull if you have some Ansible experience too.

# Some terminology

In this post, I will mostly talk about 3 things: roles, inventories and
playbooks. Other items do exist (plays, tasks, ...) but those 3 elements
shape the big picture of the layout.

## Roles

A role is a collection of tasks and templates (among other things, but
those are the most common) focused on one very specific goal. For
instance, you can have a role that installs nginx, another that deploys
ssh keys for admins, etc...

Nginx role will install and configure nginx. Nothing else. It won't
create DNS entries, trim logs, add a ftp server or anything. It just
installs nginx. Period.

## Inventories

An inventory is a list of hosts, eventually assembled into groups, on
which you will run ansible playbooks. Ansible automatically puts all defined
hosts in the aptly named group `all`.

For instance, you could have hosts `www1` and `www2`, assembled in group
`webservers`, and later reference the group or individual hosts,
depending on your needs.

Inventories can also come with variables applied to hosts or groups
(including `all`).

Inventories can be dynamic. If the inventory file is executable, Ansible
will run it and use its output as the inventory (note that, in this
case, the format is not the same as static inventory).

You can of course have multiple inventories, segregated from each other.
We will take advantage from this later on.

## Playbooks

The last piece of the puzzle is the playbook. The playbook is the pivot
between and inventory and roles. This is where you basically tell
Ansible: _please install roles foo, bar and baz on machines alice, bob
and charlie_.

# Role layout

Role layout is pretty well documented at Ansible website. A role contains
several directories. All directories are optional besides `tasks`. For each
directory, the entry point is `main.yml`. Thus, the only compulsory file in a
role is `tasks/main.yml`.

    ansible-foobar/
    ├── defaults
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── files
    ├── handlers
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── meta
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── tasks
    │   ├── check_vars.yml
    │   ├── foobar.yml
    │   └── main.yml
    └── templates
        └── foobar.conf.j2

Let's cover briefly the layout an see the function of each file and
directory.

## `defaults/main.yml`

This directory contains defaults for variables used in roles. I
encourage you to define every variable used in your role, for several
reasons:

- this file will be a nice and always up to date reference list of
  settings configuration in your roles
- having configured variables will prevent your role failing in an
  uncontrolled way (more on this later).

If some of these variables are used in templates to generate config
files, I highly encourage you to use your target OS defaults. The principle of
least surprise should apply here.

Best practices assumes that you are using _pseudo-namespacing_ for your
role's variables (e.g. for role `foobar`, all variables should begin
with `foobar_`) to avoid collisions with other roles.

## `files/`

This directory holds files that do not require Jinja interpolation, and can be copied as-is on the remote nodes.

## `handlers/main.yml`

This is where you define handlers that get notified by tasks. Handlers
are just standard tasks. You can use `include` in this file if you want
to separate handlers (for different OSes versions for instances), but
try to keep the file number as low as possible so you don't end up
hunting down stuff everywhere.

If your handler restarts any service, you have to make sure that the
service config file is valid before attempting to restart it. Some
daemons allow this (e.g. nginx, haproxy, apache). If your service does
not, provide some fallback mechanism. You don't want your playbook to
screw up your running system because you typoed a configuration
variable. See the `validate` option in the
[template module](http://docs.ansible.com/template_module.html).

Note that handlers are just standard tasks.

## `meta/main.yml`

This metadata has (AFAIK) only two variables:

- `galaxy_info`: meta information for galaxy about your role. You just
  don't need this if you don't intend to push your role to Galaxy. For
  details on the format, see [Role Metedata](https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/contributing/creating_role.html#role-metadata)
- `dependencies`: what roles this role depends on.

The latter is of utmost importance, and setting it right deserves a blog
post on it's own. Until then, the rule of thumb to remember is to __only
include compulsory role dependencies for the target host__.

This means that adding `nginx` dependency in a `php-fpm` role sounds
perfectly reasonable[^1]. However, adding a `mysql` dependency to your
web application role is not, because `mysql` can be deployed on another
server.

However, I do not use dependencies anymore. I had issues
regarding role's defaults variables behavior. Also, the playbook is the
main focus area when building infrastructure code. Having explicit
dependencies in the playbook is the way to go. No weird or hard to track
magic.

## `tasks/main.yml`

This file is the tasks entry point. However, it should be mostly empty.
Why ? Because you want to use Ansible tags. Tags are a great way to
limit task execution for an Ansible run, where only tagged tasks are
run.

For instance, in a playbook that deploys your application, you could
choose to run only tasks regarding nginx.

The problem is that tagging every task in `main.yml` would be
cumbersome, error prone, and clutter the code unnecessarily.

The best way to tag all your tasks is to include your real task file
from `tasks/main.yml` and tag the whole file:

```yaml

- import_tasks: foobar.yml
  tags:
    - foobar

```

Here, I name the real task file `foobar.yml` with the same name as the role
(quite handy with `find` or `locate`; no need to guess which `main.yml` you are
looking for) and apply the tag `foobar` to all tasks in the role.

You can repeat this if you have a big list of tasks and want to split
them in several files. You could, for instance, separate configuration
and installation matters, and add another specific tag for each of them:

```yaml

- import_tasks: foobar-install.yml
  tags:
    - foobar
    - foobar:install

- import_tasks: foobar-config.yml
  tags:
    - foobar
    - foobar:config

```

Here I added two tags to the installation part (`foobar` and
`foobar:install`), and two for the configuration part (`foobar` and
`foobar:config`).

Note that the `:` between, for instance, `foobar` and `config` has no
meaning. Ansible treats tags as dumb strings. It is just a personnal
convention (Redis like) for refining tags.

With this setup, you could run only the configuration part of your role
by issuing:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -t foobar:config`
```

The `-t` and `-l` combination is a very powerful weapon to target
a specific host with a precise change (think of this as pointing to a
matrix cell targetting host (i.e. row) and tag (i.e. column)).

### A word of caution

Do not overdo tags: most of the time, this is YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna
Need It). Create a tag if you're gonna need it. It can be hard to
mentally predict what will happen if you do too much. Beware of the
`never` tag, that will skip tasks **unless** you explicitely use another
tag.

For instance:

```yaml

- import_tasks: foobar-uninstall.yml
  tags
    - never
    - foobar

```

will execute tasks in `foobar-uninstall.yml` if tag `foobar` is
specified at the command line.

## `tasks/check_vars.yml`

I use this file to ensure that required variables are defined.

```yaml
#
# Checking that required variables are set
#
- name: Checking that required variables are set
  fail: msg="{{ item }} is not defined"
  when: item not in vars
  loop:
    - foobar_database
    - foobar_deploy_user

```

Then, include this file in `tasks/main.yml`:

```yaml

- import_tasks: check_vars.yml
  tags:
    - foobar
    - foobar:check
    - check

- import_tasks: foobar.yml
  tags:
    - foobar

```

## `templates/*`

This is the place where templates (i.e. files with interpolated
variables goes). While this is not necessary, I often reference them
using a relative path like so:

```yaml

- name: Template foo
  template:
    src: ../templates/foo.conf.j2
    dest: /some/place/in/the/node/filesystem/foo.conf

```

The goal of using relative path is to be able to hit `gf` in Vim and
open the file directly. You can get rid of that and just use `src:
foo.conf.j2`. It is just a readability/convenience tradeoff.

The file name I use is the __intended filename at the destination__,
appended with `.j2` so it is clear that it is a Jinja2 template, and
easier to search (`find` or `locate`).

Some folks like to replicate the destination hierarchy (e.g. `src: etc/sysconfig
/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethx.cfg.j2`). This is a matter of taste, but personaly I
don't see the point of having those deep hierarchies in the role if the naming is correct.

## `vars/main.yml`

It is sometimes difficult to grok the difference between
`vars/main.yml` and `defaults/main.yml`. After all, they both contain
variable assignements.

I do not always use a `vars/main.yml`, but when I do, I put "constants
like" variables in it. These are variables that are not intended to be
overriden.

For instance the github repository for a particular piece of code (e.g.
your web application) will certainly go there. However, the version you
want to deploy won't.

All in all, it is just a mechanism to take those values out of tasks files
readability and role life cycle.

# Inventories and playbook layout

A playbook glues together roles and inventories. Thus playbooks depend on roles
and inventories. But while you have mechanisms to list roles requirements in a
playbook, you don't have any for inventories.

Since the playbook can not live without the targeted inventories I include my
inventories in my playbooks.

    playbook-foobar/
    ├── ansible.cfg
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── roles/
    │   └── requirements.yml
    ├── inventories
    │   ├── development
    │   |   ├── group_vars
    │   |   │   └── all
    │   |   └── hosts
    │   ├── integration
    │   |   ├── group_vars
    │   |   │   └── all
    │   |   └── hosts
    │   └── production
    │       ├── group_vars
    │       │   └── all
    │       └── hosts
    ├── site.yml
    └── playbooks
        ├── 10_database.yml
        └── 20_stuff.yml

## `ansible.cfg`, `roles/` and `roles/requirements.yml`

This file controles ansible behaviour. You can have one in `/etc/ansible` or as
a personal dotfile (`~/.ansible.cfg`). Adding an `ansible.cfg` file in the
playbook root will ensure that the required settings for the playbook to run are
really there. The precedence order for Ansible config files is[^2]:

1. `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` (an environment variable pointing to a file)
2. `ansible.cfg` (in the current directory)
3. `.ansible.cfg` (in the home directory)
4. `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`

Ansible will use the first config file found.

In this config file, I always set at least two options:

```ini
hostfile = ./inventories/dev
roles_path = ./roles:/some/path/to/roles/repos

```

The first one (`hostfile`) sets which inventory Ansible will use. More
explanations will come below.

The second one set the path where Ansible will look for roles. I typically set
two directories here (separated by `:`, like shell's `PATH`):

- the first directory will be used by ansible galaxy to install imported
  roles. I set it to `./roles` but the name doesn't matter. Don't forget
  to add the directory content (except `requirements.yml`) in your
  playbook's `.gitignore` like so:

```gitignore
!/roles
/roles/*
!/roles/requirements.yml
```

- sometimes I add a second directory that points to my roles
  developmenent directory path

The advantages for this setup are two fold: first, you have a dedicated path,
ignored by your SCM, where you will download roles. The roles will be searched
there first. Secondly, if a role is not found, it will be searched in your role
development directory. This let you hack on your roles while writing a playbook.
You don't need to go through a _commit/push/install_ cycle when you are coding
your roles for this playbook.

Roles dependencies for your playbook are listed in `requirements.yml`
and can be installed with `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`:

```yaml

# Role on galaxy
- you.rolename
# Public role on github
- name: role-public
  src: https://github.com/erasme/role-public.git
# Private role on github
- name: role-private
  src: git+ssh://git@github.com/you/role-private.git

```

## `inventories/`

This directory holds all inventories you want to apply your playbook too. The
most common pattern is to use per-environment inventories: one for
`development`, one for `integration`, another for `production`, etc...

Of course, the `hostfile` variable in `ansible.cfg` should point to
`development` to avoid accidentaly messing with production. Executing the
playbook on non-development inventories will force you tu use the `-i`, which is
a good safety measure.

While you can define variables in groups (in `group_vars`) and hosts
(`host_vars`), you should stuff as much variables as possible in
`group_vars/all`. The rationale is that it is much easier to find a
variable when a single file is involved. Variables scattered in a dozen
of files are _not_ manageable.

And when you'll want to create an additional inventory (e.g. create `production`
from `development`), it will be much easier to change a single file and set the
variables to proper values than to do the same in several files.

Note that `group_vars/all` can be a directory containing several files. I
usually split variables in a clear text file (`group_vars/all/all`) and a
ciphered one (`group_vars/all_secret`).

Since the first revision of this post, ansible added the possibility to vault a
single variable in an inventory. Use it !

Here is a handy bash alias that crypts text selected with a mouse:

```bash
alias vault_clip_crypt='echo Passing $(xclip -rmlastnl -o) to ansible-vault && echo -n "$(xclip -rmlastnl -o)" | ansible-vault encrypt_string'
```

For this to work you have to configure `vault_password_file = ./path_to_secret_file` and have you vault key in `./path_to_secret_file`. Of course, you should not commit `./path_to_secret_file` !

## `site.yml` and `playbooks/`

This directory contains the playbooks themselves. I always create a
"master" playbook called `site.yml` in the playbook root directory,
which includes all other playbooks located in `playbooks/`.

I prefix playbooks with a number (Basic style) so I get a sense of the
order playbook will be executed just by looking at `playbooks/` content.

For instance:

```yaml

#!/usr/bin/env ansible-playbook

- import_playbook: playbooks/10_database.yml
- import_playbook: playbooks/20_stuff.yml

```

The rationale is to be able to use `ansible-pull` easily if needed (`ansible-
pull`, by default, tries to execute a playbook called`site.yml`). The other
point is to split playbook in related parts.

For instance, you could have a playbook the takes care of setting up the
database, another that will set the OS level stuff (e.g. ssh keys, firewalling,
...), another one that takes care of deploying your web application, etc... When
needed, You can use all the playbooks at once with `site.yml`, or just focus on
a specific problem running the appropriate playbook (no need to run the ssh-key
setup if you're just deploying the latest version of your web application).

The shebang line at the top of the file (`#!/usr/bin/env ansible-playbook`) will
make the playbook directly executable (adjust `ansible-playbook` path and `chmod
+x` the playbook file). You can still pass additional
`ansible-playbook` parameters if required.

## `requirements.txt`

This file contains the result of a `pip freeze`. I now only use `pip`
under `virtualenv` to install ansible and required modules. It makes it
really easy to switch ansible (and even python) version between
projects.

So when someone needs to work on this project, the workflow is simple:

```bash

git clone http://github.com/some/playbook-repos
cd playbook-repos
mkvirtualenv playbook-repos --no-site-packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
ansible-galaxy install -r roles/requirements.yml

```

and you're good to go.

# Layout Antipatterns

When I started using Ansible, I cumulated several antipatterns at the
same time: trying to emcompass all my infrastructure in a single
inventory containing per-host fine grained variables, used in a single
playbook, without using any role.

While this sounds feasible, it is doomed to failure unless you manage a
very small infrastructure. Let's zoom in briefly on each mistake.

## Trying to encompass all your infrastructure in one playbook

Is is tempting to aim for a one-liner that will magically deploy all
your infrastructure in one shot. This gives you some bragging rights at
your next meetup, and feels like the ultimate sysadmin masterpiece.

However, it has many drawbacks:

- it will be slow: do you really want to run a playbook over dozens of
  more tasks or roles, just to change an entry in `/etc/hosts` ? Yes,
there are workaround for this, but it will require some command line
magic, a lot of thinking.

- it mixes bananas and apples: you should strive for separation of concerns in
  your playbooks if you want be able to read them (and, as a consequence,
  maintain them).

As a consequence, your infrastructure code will be unnecessary hard to
test and maintain.

## Per-host fine grained variables

This is a corolary of the previous antipattern: when you try to
encompass your whole infrastructure, you start to think, inheritance,
variables overriding and refining.

And while doing this, you add considerable complexity to your
inventories. It is very hard to track down variables definitions when
you overrides them in `group_vars/some_group`, `group_vars/all`,
`hosts_vars/machine`, role defaults, ...

Now this can get even worse when you use the `hash_behavior: merge`
Ansible configuration setting: it introduces more confusion, and makes
your Ansible work potentially unshareable with people using
`hash_behaviour: replace`. Since I am
[guilty](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/e28e538c6ed7520ecef305c776eb6036aff42d06)
on this one, it is time to make some apologies. Sorry folks. Michael
DeHaan did not like it, and he was right.

## Single playbook

A single playbook relates to the first Sin again, but also applies to
more focused playbooks where you only deploy one thing. Splitting your
playbooks between various logically related roles will fasten your
deployments. Again, why running ssh key distribution, storage cluster
deployment, web stack, middlewares and application when you just change
the color of a button in your web app ?

Split your playbook in related parts that reflects your stack
architecture. They will be faster and easier to use.

## No roles (tasks only)

Well, this is obvious. Even if you don't want to share, make roles and
strive for code reuse. Reused code will save you time of course, but it
is also battle tested since it is used more frequently.

Tasks-only playbook can be used for a quick hit and run, solving a
transient problem that doesn't offer any code reuse opportunities.

I also try to avoid tasks along roles in playbooks: this hurts the
abstraction level you manage to build using roles. When thinking in
terms of roles, you don't need to think about the nitty gritty details
of the roles when reading your playbooks. If your roles are thouroughly
tested, you can read your infrastructure in seconds. Add tasks to the
mix, and you loose this superpower.
